> "The reality is, most people don’t put in the time to keep up and learn. That’s always given me a competitive advantage." - Mark Cuban

> "A person who is happy is not because everything is right in his life, He is happy because of his attitude towards everything in his life is right." - Sundar Pichai

> "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life" - Michael Jordan
